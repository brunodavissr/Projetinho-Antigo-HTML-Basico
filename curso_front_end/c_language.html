        <h1>History of C language</h1>

        <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972
        and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
        [6] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[7][8]
        with C compilers available for the almost all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by
        ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</P>
